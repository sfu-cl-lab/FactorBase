Dealing with the Main Functor Constraint. The auxilliary functor nodes are those that are not main functor nodes. The aux edges are the ones that point to an auxilliary node. 
Our approach is this: for each node in the relationship lattice, find the nodes in its associated Bayes net. If such a node is an auxilliary node, any edge pointing into this node is forbidden.
This builds a fairly large view. We could be more efficient in terms of storage by computing this dynamically as we learn the Bayes nets going up the lattice.
